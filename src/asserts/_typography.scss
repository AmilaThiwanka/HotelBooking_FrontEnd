 * Base Rules for typography
 * Declare once, site-wide styles
 *
 * A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a
 * descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes.
 * It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default
 * styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.
 *
 * Typography styles for form elements should be done in forms.scss
